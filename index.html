    <h1>AWARENESS ABOUT TOBACCO</h1>
    <p><font size="5">Tobacco is a plant with leaves that contain high levels of the addictive chemical nicotine. After harvesting, tobacco leaves are cured, aged, and processed in various ways. The resulting products may be smoked (in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes), applied to the gums (as dipping and chewing tobacco), or inhaled (as snuff). Tobacco use is highly addictive and harmful to health.</font></p>

    <h2>HARMFUL EFFECTS OF TOBACCO</h2>
    <p><font size="5">Tobacco increases a person's risk of cancer, heart disease, and stroke. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cigarette smoking harms almost all organs in the body and reduces the health of smokers in general. Smoking also significantly raises the risk of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema. Additionally, tobacco use is linked to premature aging, oral diseases, and a weaker immune system.</font></p>

    <h3>Long-Term Effects of Tobacco Use</h3>
    <p><font size="5">Long-term tobacco use leads to a variety of chronic diseases, many of which are fatal. Smokers often face increased risks of respiratory problems, such as chronic bronchitis and lung cancer. The nicotine in tobacco is a highly addictive substance, making quitting smoking difficult for many individuals. Secondhand smoke from tobacco use is also dangerous and can negatively affect the health of those who are exposed to it.</font></p>

    <h3>Impact on the Environment</h3>
    <p><font size="5">Tobacco farming and production contribute to deforestation, as large areas of land are cleared for growing tobacco plants. Additionally, cigarette butts are one of the most common forms of litter, contributing to environmental pollution. The chemicals from tobacco products can contaminate soil and water sources, further damaging ecosystems.</font></p>

    <h3>Social and Economic Costs</h3>
    <p><font size="5">Tobacco use has significant social and economic impacts, not only on the individuals who use tobacco but also on society as a whole. Healthcare costs for treating tobacco-related diseases are extremely high, and tobacco use often leads to premature death, reducing the workforce and productivity. The burden of tobacco-related diseases also falls on family members and communities who are affected by loss or caregiving responsibilities.</font></p>

    <h3>Quitting Tobacco</h3>
    <p><font size="5">Quitting tobacco is one of the best decisions you can make for your health. There are various resources and support programs available to help individuals quit smoking or using tobacco products. These include counseling, medications, nicotine replacement therapy, and community-based programs.</font></p>

    <h3>Help and Resources</h3>
    <p><font size="5">If you or someone you know is trying to quit tobacco, there are many organizations that provide resources and support. The CDC, the American Lung Association, and the National Cancer Institute offer tools and guidance to help individuals stop smoking and live healthier lives.</font></p>
